Description: This R package provides facilities for the microbiome higher criticism analysis (MiHC) which tests the association between a microbial group (e.g., community or clade) composition and a host phenotype of interest. MiHC is a data-driven omnibus test taken in a search space spanned by tailoring the higher criticism test to incorporate phylogenetic information and/or modulate sparsity levels and including the Simes test for excessively high sparsity levels.
